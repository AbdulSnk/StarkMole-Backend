# User Module

The User module handles user management, authentication, and role-based access control for the StarkMole Backend.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with JWT tokens
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with configurable salt rounds
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin and Player roles with protected endpoints
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profiles
- **Wallet Integration**: Support for StarkNet wallet addresses
- **Data Transfer Objects**: Secure data handling with validation and transformation

## Entities

- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user (Admin only)

## Security Features

- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Guards**: Protect endpoints based on user roles
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with configurable salt rounds
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive DTO validation
