# StarkMole-Backend Security Audit Report

**Report Generated:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive security audit of the StarkMole-Backend application, covering code, APIs, data storage, and authentication. The audit identified several areas for improvement, which are detailed in this report. The primary goal is to identify and remediate vulnerabilities to enhance the overall security posture.

## 2. Scope

The audit covers the following areas:

- **Codebase Analysis:** Static analysis of the entire codebase for security vulnerabilities, including secret scanning and dependency analysis.
- **API Security:** Testing of all API endpoints for common vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, CSRF, and IDOR.
- **Data Storage:** Review of data storage mechanisms for sensitive data exposure and misconfigurations.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Evaluation of authentication flows, token management, and role-based access control.

## 3. Methodology

The audit was conducted using a combination of automated tools and manual review:

- **Automated Scanning:**
  - **Snyk:** Dependency scanning to identify vulnerable packages.
  - **SonarQube:** Static code analysis to detect security hotspots and bugs.
  - **OWASP ZAP:** Dynamic application security testing (DAST) for API endpoints.
- **Manual Review:**
  - **Code Review:** Line-by-line inspection of critical code paths, focusing on authentication, authorization, and data handling.
  - **API Testing:** Manual testing of API endpoints using tools like Postman and Burp Suite.
  - **Configuration Review:** Inspection of configuration files for security misconfigurations.

## 4. Findings & Recommendations

### 4.1. High-Priority Vulnerabilities

| ID | Vulnerability | Description | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VULN-001** | **Hardcoded Secrets in Code** | Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords) were found in the codebase, posing a high risk if the code is compromised. | Remove all hardcoded secrets and use environment variables or a secret management service. |
| **VULN-002** | **SQL Injection (SQLi)** | Potential SQL injection vectors were identified in raw SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries. | Use a query builder or ORM to construct all database queries and avoid raw SQL. |
| **VULN-003** | **Broken Authentication** | JWTs have no expiration, allowing indefinite use of compromised tokens. | Implement JWT expiration and a token revocation mechanism. |

### 4.2. Medium-Priority Vulnerabilities

| ID | Vulnerability | Description | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VULN-004** | **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Some API endpoints return unvalidated user input, which could lead to stored XSS vulnerabilities. | Implement input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied data. |
| **VULN-005** | **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** | Some endpoints expose internal object IDs, which could be manipulated by attackers to access unauthorized resources. | Replace internal IDs with non-sequential, random identifiers (e.g., UUIDs) in all API responses. |
| **VULN-006** | **Security Misconfiguration** | Debugging and verbose error messages are enabled in the production environment, which can leak sensitive information. | Disable debugging and verbose error messages in production. |

### 4.3. Low-Priority Vulnerabilities

| ID | Vulnerability | Description | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **VULN-007** | **Lack of Security Headers** | Security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Content-Type-Options` are missing, which can expose the application to various attacks. | Implement appropriate security headers in all API responses. |
| **VULN-008** | **Vulnerable Dependencies** | Several outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities were identified. | Regularly update all dependencies and use a tool like Snyk to monitor for new vulnerabilities. |

## 5. Remediation Plan

A detailed remediation plan with timelines and assigned owners should be created based on this report. High-priority vulnerabilities should be addressed immediately, followed by medium and low-priority issues.

## 6. Conclusion

The audit identified several critical and high-priority vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. By following the recommendations in this report, the security of the StarkMole-Backend can be significantly improved. Regular security audits and continuous monitoring are recommended to maintain a strong security posture.
